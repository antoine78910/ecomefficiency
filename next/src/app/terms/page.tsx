            <p>
              Ecom Efficiency ("the Platform", "we", "our") is an online membership service that facilitates access to a
              curated selection of premium digital tools provided by third-party service providers.

            <p className="mt-2">
              We are not the owner, reseller, distributor, or official partner of these tools, nor do we provide them
              directly. We act solely as a facilitator of shared access for our members.

              provided by third parties, over which Ecom Efficiency has no control or responsibility.
